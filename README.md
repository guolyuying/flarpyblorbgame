# Flarpy Blorb (game)
I recreated the mobile game Flappy Bird (2013) in Unity by following the YouTube tutorial by Game Maker's Toolkit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM
The purpose of this project is to pratice Unity game development for myself. No commercial intentions.
All 2D art assets created by me in Procreate; Sound effects downloaded form https://freesound.org/
